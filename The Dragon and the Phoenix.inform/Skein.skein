A large oaken log is slowly burning in the fireplace, producing more heat than light. Shadows dance around the room, barely lighting the faces of the people here. &#x000A;&#x000A;Next to the far side of the bar, on the west side of the tavern, there is a green door with a circular window, apparently leading to the garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;A door made out of brown logs held together by metal rings is on the south wall. The coat rack and the welcome mat next to it suggest it is the front door.&#x000A;&#x000A;A surly, bald man stands behind the bar, absent-mindedly washing a glass with an extremely dirty cloth.&#x000A;&#x000A;A tall man wearing a long, gray cloak and eyepatch is sitting, cross-legged, next to the fire. He is carrying a long staff. Many silver hairs shimmer in his otherwise dark beard. A raven is sitting on his shoulder. He seems like a person that would be worthwile to listen to.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above the fireplace hangs a peculiar engraving of a bird that appears to be on fire.

When Mom finally brought you home, you were so tired you were not even able to have your dinner. You just fell in your bed in the flat's corridor, and doze off.&#x000A;&#x000A;Tavern&#x000A;In your sleep, you try rolling around in your bed. It feels surprusingly hard, and you wake up startled, next to a lit fireplace. You are in a large room with several long wooden tables with benches, and a bar. Next to it you can see a stairway leading down. A large oaken log is slowly burning in the fireplace, producing more heat than light. Shadows dance around the room, barely lighting the faces of the people here. &#x000A;&#x000A;Next to the far side of the bar, on the west side of the tavern, there is a green door with a circular window, apparently leading to the garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;A door made out of brown logs held together by metal rings is on the south wall. The coat rack and the welcome mat next to it suggest it is the front door.&#x000A;&#x000A;A surly, bald man stands behind the bar, absent-mindedly washing a glass with an extremely dirty cloth.&#x000A;&#x000A;A tall man wearing a long, gray cloak and eyepatch is sitting, cross-legged, next to the fire. He is carrying a long staff. Many silver hairs shimmer in his otherwise dark beard. A raven is sitting on his shoulder. He seems like a person that would be worthwile to listen to.&#x000A;&#x000A;Above the fireplace hangs a peculiar engraving of a bird that appears to be on fire. You notice that occasionally the tall man throws a look at it and appears very thoughtful.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
